How to install and test Apache tomcat 6

1. Download Apache tomcat 6.0.37
2. Extract it to a specific location
3. Set environment variables CATALINA_HOME to the location where tomcat is extracted
4. Set environment variable CATALINA as %CATALINA_HOME%\bin (This is not required I believe).
5. Add the CATALINA variable to your PATH variable
6. Run command prompt as Administrator.
7. Navigate to C:/>
8. Run C:/> service.bat install

	* If u see following output then the tomcat is successfully installed.
		Installing the service 'Tomcat6' ...
		Using CATALINA_HOME:    "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6"
		Using CATALINA_BASE:    "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6"
		Using JAVA_HOME:        "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_40"
		Using JVM:              "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_40\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll"
		The service 'Tomcat6' has been installed.

9. Starting up apache tomcat web-server
	If u have already setup CATALINA variable then type
		* C:/> startup
	Else u need to type 
		* C:/>%CATALINA_HOME%/bin/startup

	The normal startup will be something like this:
		Using CATALINA_BASE:   "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6"
		Using CATALINA_HOME:   "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6"
		Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6\temp"
		Using JRE_HOME:        "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_40"
		Using CLASSPATH:       "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6\bin\bootstrap.jar"

10. Stopping up apache tomcat web-server
	If you have setup CATALINA variable
		* C:/> shutdown.bat [Note: .bat is important here as the command "shutdown" refers to the default shutdown utily of windows i.e 
					shutdown.exe in system32 folder]
	
	Else u need to type
		* C:/>%CATALINA_HOME%/bin/shutdown
			OR
		* C:/>%CATALINA_HOME%/bin/shutdown.batour server.
setup y

	The normal shutdown process will be something like this:
		Using CATALINA_BASE:   "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6"
		Using CATALINA_HOME:   "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6"
		Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6\temp"
		Using JRE_HOME:        "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_40"
		Using CLASSPATH:       "D:\Jugaad\apache-tomcat-6\bin\bootstrap.jar"


11. To Test the server open up your browser window and type "http://localhost:8080"
	- This will show you an index page which implies you have successfully setup your server.

12. What can go wrong??

	The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that
    	matter) has laid claim to port 8080.  This is the default HTTP port that
    	Tomcat attempts to bind to at startup.  To change this, open the file:

      		 $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml

	and search for '8080'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is
	greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser
	access to bind under UNIX.
	
	Restart Tomcat and you're in business.  Be sure that you replace the "8080"
	in the URL you're using to access Tomcat.  For example, if you change the
	port to 1977, you would request the URL http://localhost:1977/ in your browser.
