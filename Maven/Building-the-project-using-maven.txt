Building the project using maven

1. On the command prompt browse to the directory that contains your pom.xml

2. Run command "mvn package" <without quotes, if u r not sensible enough> :p
	- Here package is a phase. A phase is a step in the build lifecycle, which is an ordered sequence of phases. 
	  When a phase is given, Maven will execute every phase in the sequence up to and including the one defined.

3. Now execute the following command to run the program on your command prompt.
	java -cp target/<artifactId>-<version>.<packaging> <groupId>.<the main class>
	
	eg:	java -cp target/myFirstSpring-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.spring.myFirstSpring.App

	* Refer to your pom.xml for more details.
