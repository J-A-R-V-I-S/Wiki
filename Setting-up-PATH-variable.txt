Setting up PATH variable

1. Right click on My Computer and select Properties

2. Click Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables under Advanced Tab

3. If you are creating the PATH variable for the first time.
	* Click 'New' under 'User Variables'.
	* Give the name as PATH
	* Give value as .;<the path which contains your executable files>
		- '.' refers to current directory.

4. You can add other variables to your PATH variable.
	For ex: Create a variable JAVA_HOME which contains the path of your JDK folder.
		Create JAVA_BIN to contain path of the bin folder inside JDK folder. This can be done as
			JAVA_BIN = %JAVA_HOME%\bin
		Now add JAVA_BIN in your PATH as follows:
			PATH = .;%JAVA_BIN%

5. If you want to add more variables to your PATH file then you can do it as follows:
		PATH = .;%JAVA_BIN%;%M2% and so on.
